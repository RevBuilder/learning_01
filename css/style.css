/*
  CSS box-shadow property is used to apply one or more shadows to an element.  
  The default color is current text-color.
  Going from left to right:  The first 0px is the right shadow for the right boarder.  The second 0px is the shadow for the bottom boarder.  The 3px is the blur of the shadow.  The black color is only needed should you change the text color to a light color as the blur does not show when used to create this elevated look.
